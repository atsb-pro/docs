# Trading

Trading is one of the main directories of our project. It contains only one file but comunicates with several outside of **Trading**. So the main task for this part is to send a message to us "WHAT TO DO TODAY". Calculating the data for today and yesterday the code will decide what to do with the shares eather to buy them or sell.
