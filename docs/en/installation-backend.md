# Backend Architecture: The Engine Behind ATSB

![](/images/backend.jpg)

The backend is where ATSB’s automation, reliability, and data integrity are orchestrated. It quietly ensures that the website, Telegram bot, and analysis scripts are **always working with the freshest and most accurate data**.

## Core Mechanics

The backend can be thought of as **a multi-layered engine**:

- **Data Pipeline:** Fetches stock prices, cleans the data, and converts it into a consistent JSON format.  
- **Task Automation:** Periodically updates historical datasets, maintaining a complete record without manual intervention.  
- **Service Endpoints:** Provides controlled access for the frontend, trading bot, and potential future clients.  
- **Error Handling & Monitoring:** Tracks API failures, missing data, and processing errors to ensure smooth operations.

## Daily Workflow

Every night, the backend executes a carefully sequenced routine:

1. Connect to multiple data providers securely.  
2. Pull the latest prices and volumes for all tracked symbols.  
3. Validate the data for gaps or anomalies, correcting where possible.  
4. Store the clean dataset in a centralized location, ready for frontend and bot consumption.  
5. Log all actions for traceability and troubleshooting.

This ensures that every morning, users see **complete and reliable information**, without manual updates.

## Technical Highlights

- **Incremental Loading:** Handles large datasets efficiently, avoiding API rate limits.  
- **Centralized JSON Hub:** A single source of truth for all downstream modules.  
- **Cron Scheduling on Cloud Servers:** Automates routine tasks reliably.  
- **Flexible Integration:** Designed to allow new analytics modules or third-party tools to connect effortlessly.

## The Philosophy

Instead of being just a data store, the backend is a **living system**:

- It ensures consistency across all platforms.  
- It provides the groundwork for innovation, like adding new indicators, dashboards, or trading algorithms.  
- It allows the frontend and Telegram bot to focus purely on user interaction, leaving the heavy lifting to a robust engine.

The backend exemplifies **scalable, reliable, and maintainable system design**, supporting ATSB’s vision of accessible, data-driven trading.
