## Exploring Stocks Visually

Instead of staring at numbers, users can **interact with charts**:

- Hover over candlesticks to see exact prices and volumes.  
- Toggle moving averages to spot trends instantly.  
- Highlight buy/sell signals over historical periods.  

Dynamic zooming lets users focus on a day, week, or year, revealing patterns that are often missed in static tables.
