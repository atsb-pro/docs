## Backtesting Takes Center Stage

Our project introduces a powerful approach to building a reliable trading strategy: backtesting. This technique allows us to explore different possibilities without real-world risk.

Imagine a virtual trading arena fueled by historical data. Here, we unleash various trading strategies, each with its own decision-making process. Through backtesting, we evaluate their performance, identifying the strategy that consistently delivers profits while remaining stable â€“ a key factor in mitigating risk.

Stay tuned to discover the intricate details of this backtesting process and how it unlocks the optimal trading strategy for your success.




## Key Idea

Our project innovates by testing a diverse set of trading strategies. Each strategy has a unique decision-making process and considers a "power index" to determine investment strength. This power index dynamically adjusts buying/selling quantities. By testing various strategies with this power-based approach, we aim to find the optimal balance between profitability and risk tolerance.

## Technical Breakdown

### Modular Design

We've divided the project into smaller modules for cleaner code and easier maintenance. These modules reside in separate directories to avoid redundancy.
Reusable Code: The stockutils directory contains reusable utility functions used for various stock analysis tasks. This promotes efficient development and reduces code duplication.

### Core Functionality

`runner.py` - This script is the heart of the backtesting process. It analyzes historical data for multiple stocks, simulating different trading strategies with varying power levels and timeframes. By testing a wide range of possibilities, it aims to identify the most successful strategy.

`score.py` -  This script defines a function that calculates the optimal buying or selling power based on a particular strategy and market conditions. It essentially determines the ideal investment strength for each trade.

## Benefits

**Data-Driven Approach:** We rely on historical data to guide our strategy development, increasing the chance of success compared to purely theoretical approaches.

**Risk Management:** By testing with different power levels, we can find a strategy that balances potential gains with risk tolerance. 

**Optimization for Stability and Profit:** Our goal is to identify a strategy that delivers consistent profitability while minimizing risk.
This backtesting approach allows us to fine-tune a trading strategy that leverages historical trends while adapting to different market conditions.

## Additional Notes

While backtesting offers valuable insights, it's essential to remember that past performance doesn't guarantee future results.
The success of the overall project will depend on the quality and comprehensiveness of the historical data used for backtesting.
