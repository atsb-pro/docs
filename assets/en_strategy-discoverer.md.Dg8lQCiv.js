Of course, we take into account that in order to improve the chances for successful strategy, we have to run each one of them on a different time period. <code>score.py</code> contains a function to calculate the power with which we must sell or buy a stock. <code>runner.py</code> uses this function in its system.</p><p><em>To find out which functions <code>runner.py</code> uses, click here</em> - Utility functions</p>',4),n=[a];function c(d,h,p,f,l,u){return o(),t("div",null,n)}const g=e(i,[["render",c]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
