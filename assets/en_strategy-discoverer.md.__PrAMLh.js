This technique allows us to explore different possibilities without real-world risk.</p><p>Imagine a virtual trading arena fueled by historical data. Here, we unleash various trading strategies, each with its own decision-making process. Through backtesting, we evaluate their performance, identifying the strategy that consistently delivers profits while remaining stable – a key factor in mitigating risk.</p><p>Stay tuned to discover the intricate details of this backtesting process and how it unlocks the optimal trading strategy for your success.</p><h2 id="key-idea" tabindex="-1">Key Idea <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-idea" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Idea&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Our project innovates by testing a diverse set of trading strategies. Each strategy has a unique decision-making process and considers a &quot;power index&quot; to determine investment strength. This power index dynamically adjusts buying/selling quantities. By testing various strategies with this power-based approach, we aim to find the optimal balance between profitability and risk tolerance.</p><h2 id="technical-breakdown" tabindex="-1">Technical Breakdown <a class="header-anchor" href="#technical-breakdown" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Technical Breakdown&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="modular-design" tabindex="-1">Modular Design <a class="header-anchor" href="#modular-design" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Modular Design&quot;">​</a></h3><p>We&#39;ve divided the project into smaller modules for cleaner code and easier maintenance.
